Accessibility Refactoring Challenge: Marketing Agency Website

Welcome to the Accessibility Refactoring Challenge! In this project, I've undertaken the task of enhancing the existing marketing agency website to align with modern web development practices, focusing on accessibility, user experience, and search engine optimization.

Changes Made
Throughout this challenge, I made several significant improvements to the original code:

Semantic HTML Elements: I overhauled the HTML structure by incorporating semantic HTML elements. This change enhances accessibility and clarifies content for both users and search engines.

Logical Content Order: I restructured the HTML elements to ensure a logical order, even without styling. This guarantees improved usability for all users, including those with disabilities.

Descriptive alt Attributes: All image elements were updated with descriptive alt attributes. These attributes provide context for screen readers and improve accessibility.

Heading Hierarchy: I reviewed and adjusted heading levels to create a meaningful hierarchy. This fosters better content organization and aids accessibility and SEO.

Concise Title Element: The <title> element was revised to provide a concise and descriptive summary of the webpage. This improves both accessibility and SEO.

CSS Refactoring: I optimized the CSS code by consolidating selectors and properties, resulting in a cleaner and more efficient codebase.
